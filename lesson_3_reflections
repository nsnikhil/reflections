When would you want ot create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

--> when i want to work remoltely from other place or let other contribute to this project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

--> I might be working on some file code that is buggy and dont want ot up live and also if i make some changes on github i dont want it to be pulled until and unless im sure about it

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

--> fork - clone of repos on github itself, clone - making a copy of a repo in your local machine, branch - pointer to commits

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

--> its makes merging easier and with less conflicts since changes can made to both github and to local branch and that lasy know location will help to figure of what all changes were made from that point

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

--> Mostly using some cord of cloud storage medium, but then it would be totaly in efficient ot manage versions of each file

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

--> when you want to make some changes that are experimental in nature and might break the entire project, its better to create a new branch and test those changes their and later merge them if thay are useful to you.
